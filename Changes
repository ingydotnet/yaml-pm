- Error in YAML::Dumper in case YAML was not loaded earlier (CHORNY, RT#19838)


---
version: 0.72
date:    Wed Sep 1 11:54:00 AEST 2010
changes:
- Upgrade to Module::Install 1.00
- Upgraded author tests via new ADAMK release automation

---
version: 0.71
date:    Sun Jan 3 12:25:00 AEST 2010
changes:
- Set file encoding to UTF-8 in LoadFile/DumpFile (RT#25434) by Olivier Mengué
- We shouldn't have to care about 5.8.0. Since it's causing CPAN Testers
  failures, bump the minimum Perl to 5.8.1

---
version: 0.70
date:    Tue Aug 11 02:52:10 AEST 2009
changes:
- Updated Module::Install dependency to 0.91
- Bumping dependency to 5.8.0 but I think it's only in the test suite.
  However, I can't prove it. So if anyone wants 5.6 compatibility back
  you need to fix or rewrite the test suite.
